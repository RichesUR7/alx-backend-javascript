Introduction
This repository contains solutions and explanations for the ES6 Basics project. The tasks include practical exercises focusing on ES6 features such as constants, block-scoped variables, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameters, spread syntax, string templating, object property shorthand, iterators, and for-of loops.

Concepts Covered
By completing this project, you will gain proficiency in:

Understanding ES6 and its new features.
Differentiating between constants and variables in JavaScript.
Utilizing block-scoped variables effectively.
Implementing arrow functions and leveraging default parameters.
Using rest and spread operators for functions and arrays.
Applying string templating for cleaner and more readable code.
Enhancing object creation with property value shorthand and computed property names.
Iterating over collections using iterators and for-of loops.
Setup
To run this project, ensure you have Node.js (v12.11.x) installed. Use the following commands in your terminal to set up:

bash
Copy code
# Install Node.js (if not already installed)
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y

# Check Node.js and npm versions
node -v
npm -v

# Clone the repository and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/username/es6-basics.git
cd es6-basics
npm install
Tasks Overview
This project includes multiple tasks covering various ES6 concepts. Each task is implemented in a separate JavaScript file and tested using Jest. Here’s a brief overview of the tasks:

Const or let?: Transitioning from var to const and let.
Block Scope: Understanding block-scoped variables.
Arrow Functions: Converting standard functions to arrow functions.
Parameter Defaults: Implementing default parameters concisely.
Rest Parameter Syntax: Using the rest parameter syntax in functions.
Spread Operator: Concatenating arrays and strings using spread syntax.
Template Literals: Enhancing string concatenation with template literals.
Object Property Shorthand: Simplifying object creation with shorthand syntax.
Computed Property Names: Utilizing computed property names in objects.
ES6 Method Properties: Refactoring object methods using ES6 syntax.
For...of Loops: Iterating through arrays with for-of loops.
Iterator: Implementing iterators for custom objects.
Iterate through Object: Iterating through nested objects and arrays.
