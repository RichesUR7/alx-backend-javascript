## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows developers to build scalable network applications using JavaScript on the server side. This directory will guide you through key concepts such as modules, asynchronous programming, and basic server creation.

## Files and Directories

- **`index.js`**: The main entry point for the application. Contains basic code to get started with Node.js.
- **`package.json`**: Manages project dependencies and scripts. This file is essential for handling Node.js modules and packages.
- **`README.md`**: This file. Provides an overview and instructions for the project.
- **`examples/`**: Contains example scripts demonstrating various Node.js features and concepts.
- **`notes/`**: Contains markdown files with notes and explanations about different Node.js topics.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x05-NodeJS-Basics.git
   cd 0x05-NodeJS-Basics
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

   Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   To run the main script:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   You can also run the example scripts located in the `examples/` directory by replacing `index.js` with the desired script name.

## Usage

Explore the example scripts in the `examples/` directory to see different Node.js functionalities in action. Each script demonstrates specific concepts, such as file operations, HTTP server creation, and asynchronous programming.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of Node.js.
