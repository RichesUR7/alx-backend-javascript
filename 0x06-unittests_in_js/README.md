# 0x06. Unittests in JS

Welcome to the `0x06. Unittests in JS` directory! This repository is designed to help you get hands-on experience with unit testing in JavaScript. Unit tests are an essential part of modern software development, allowing you to verify that individual components of your code work as expected.

## Directory Structure

Here's a brief overview of the contents in this directory:

- **`tests/`**: Contains all the unit test files. Each file in this directory is responsible for testing a specific module or component of your application.
- **`src/`**: Contains the source code files that are being tested. The code here should be modular and easily testable.
- **`package.json`**: Lists the project dependencies, including testing frameworks and libraries.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with unit testing in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd 0x06-Unittests-in-JS
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command installs all the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.

3. **Run Tests**

   To execute the unit tests, use:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   This command will run all the tests in the `tests/` directory using the configured testing framework (e.g., Mocha, Jest, etc.).

## Testing Framework

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing framework. Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity. It includes features such as:

- Zero configuration
- Fast and reliable test execution
- Mocking capabilities
- Snapshot testing

## Writing Tests

To write your own tests:

1. Create a new file in the `tests/` directory.
2. Write your test cases using Jest's API. For example:

   ```javascript
   const sum = require('../src/sum');

   test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
     expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
   });
   ```

3. Run `npm test` to ensure your new tests pass.
